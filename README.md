# Cardiovascular disease Predictor
A binary classification machine learning model to predict heart conditions based on a heart dataset combining common clinical features which are connected to heart diseases

## About the project
During the project the dataset was firstly used to perfom data analytics and secondly used to implement and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the occurence of a heart failure based on clinical features from patients.

## The Data
###### *Used data sets: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from kaggle.com*

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features
